#Requires AutoHotkey v2.0-a


/*
    Function: RMH_Move
    
    Parameters:
    [milliseconds]: integer
    - The number of milliseconds the key is held down for

    [primary]: string
    - the key input you want to make 
        - "w" (Forwards)
        - "a" (Left)
        - "s" (Down)
        - "d" (Right)

    [Secondary]: string
    - an optional second key to hold down, for diagonal movement
        - "w" (Forwards)
        - "a" (Left)
        - "s" (Down)
        - "d" (Right)

    Examples:
        RMH_Move(3000, "w") 
        - Move forwards for 3000 milliseconds

        RMH_Move(3000, "w", "a")
        - Move diagonally forwards and left for 3000 milliseconds

    Notes:
        - Ensure you activate the Roblox window using WinActivate first for 100% accuracy
        - Inputting two keys that are opposites will surely cancel out the movement, such as W and S

    Function: RMH_RotateCamera
        
        Parameters:
            [milliseconds]: integer 
            - The number of milliseconds the key is held down for

            [direction]: string
            - The direction to rotate the camera towards
                - "left": turns the camera left
